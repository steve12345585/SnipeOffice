/** Translate cell function keywords.

    Provides a convenient way to translate a string keyword used as
    a cell function argument.  Since Calc's built-in cell functions don't
    localize string keywords, this is used mainly to deal with an Excel
    document where string names may be localized.

    To use, simply call the

       ScCellKeywordTranslator::transKeyword(...)

    function.

    Note that the function only finds a string with matching locale and opcode.
    Locale is matched as close as possible */
