/** Adapter that enables adding listeners as weak UNO references.  Thus, adding
    an object as listener to a broadcaster does not increase its reference
    count.

    <p>The helper class, of course, is held as hard reference at the
    broadcaster, but this should never be a problem as the adapter's life time
    depends on no other object.</p>

    <p>Note that in order to remove an object as listener, you have to remove
    the same wrapper that you added, i.e., you should store the adapter as a
    member in the adapted class for later use.</p>
