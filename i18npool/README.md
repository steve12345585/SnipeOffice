# Internationalisation Pool (i18npool) Framework

Internationalisation pool (i18npool) framework ensures that the suite is adaptable to the
requirements of different native languages, their local settings and customs, etc without source
code modification. (Wow, that is such marketing-speak...)

Specifically for locale data documentation please see `i18npool/source/localedata/data/locale.dtd`
