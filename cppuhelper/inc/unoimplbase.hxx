This is a straight copy of the include/comphelper/unoimplbase.hxx file, copied here

This class is meant to be used as a base class for UNO object implementations that
want to use std::mutex for locking.
It meant to be virtually inherited, so the base class is shared between
the UNO object and helper classes like comphelper::OPropertySetHelper
