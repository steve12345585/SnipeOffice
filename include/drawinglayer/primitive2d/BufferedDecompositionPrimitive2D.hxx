/** BufferedDecompositionPrimitive2D class

    Baseclass for all C++ implementations of css::graphic::XPrimitive2D
    which want to buffer the decomposition result

    Buffering the decomposition is the most-used buffering and is thus used my most
    primitive implementations which support a decomposition as base class.

    The buffering is done by holding the last decomposition in the local parameter
    maBuffered2DDecomposition. The default implementation of get2DDecomposition checks
    if maBuffered2DDecomposition is empty. If yes, it uses create2DDecomposition
    to create the content. In all cases, maBuffered2DDecomposition is returned.

    For view-dependent primitives derived from Primitive2DBufferDecomposition more needs
    to be done when the decomposition depends on parts of the parameter ViewInformation2D.
    This defines a standard method for processing these:

    Implement a view-dependent get2DDecomposition doing the following steps:
    (a) Locally extract needed parameters from ViewInformation2D to new, local parameters
        (this may be a complete local copy of ViewInformation2D)
    (b) If a buffered decomposition exists, check if one of the new local parameters
        differs from the corresponding locally remembered (as member) ones. If yes,
        clear maBuffered2DDecomposition
    (d) call baseclass::get2DDecomposition which will use create2DDecomposition
        to fill maBuffered2DDecomposition if it's empty
    (e) copy the new local parameters to the corresponding locally remembered ones
        to identify if a new decomposition is needed at the next call
    (f) return maBuffered2DDecomposition
